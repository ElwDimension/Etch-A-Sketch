# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a project to create a sort of Etch-A-Sketch in a browser based on guidelines from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). Users will be able to input the size of grid they want, the page will create that size grid for them, and then they will be able to color squares in it with their mouse.
